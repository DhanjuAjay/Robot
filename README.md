Toy Robot Simulator
===================

* I have created a playground file to simulate the robot movement.

* Steps to run the program:
  - First add moves in moves.txt file.
  - moves.txt file is in resources folder.
  - Now open the project file 'Robot'.
  - At bottom left corner click play button.
  - Output will be shown in Console.
  
* I have developed a robust code that will not let robot fall fron 5*5 table.
* I tried to keep code readable.
* I also use multiple cases to test the project.
